BlazingNest
BlazingNest is a free and open-source plugin for Rhino 3D that generates borders and marks of selected parts and orients them on the XY plane so that they can be fed to a CNC cutting machine. This plugin simplifies the process of preparing designs for CNC cutting, making it easy for users to create precise and accurate cuts.

Features
BlazingNest offers a variety of advanced features for analyzing and optimizing the nesting process. Some of its key features include:

Automatic generation of borders and marks for selected parts
Orientation of parts on the XY plane for CNC cutting
Intersection graph analysis to identify connected components and calculate boundary components
Scaling and orienting surfaces based on the centroid of the Brep for improved accuracy and efficiency
Support for various file formats, including DXF and CSV
And more!
